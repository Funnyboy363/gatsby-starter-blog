Last week, I was given the wonderful opportunity to be a guest speaker. This was for a Web Development class at my local college. The professor of the class messaged me by linkdin to ask if I was interested and I very much was! He gave me a document went a lot of questions that I would be asked. I went through them a day prior to the interview to make sure I knew what I would say. 
<br></br>
Come the day of the interview, I was excited and prepared! It was on teams meeting so I didn't have to physically go anywhere. It was such a wonderful experience! I got to talk about what happened with me after college, all the job hunting and depression of not being able to find a job. I also talked about my experience while working the job I have now. It felt great to give some insight on what to expect after graduating. I loved it! It made me feel like I was a real developer. There was also a moment in the end where I answered a few questions that the students had as well. The whole thing went for almost an hour. 
<br></br>
This will be something I'll remember for a long time. I will look back on this and remember, this is a reason that I pushed to graduate, get my degree, and land a career in Web Development.
