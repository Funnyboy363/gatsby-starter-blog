description: "This coming week, it will be a different routine"

Before I started this blog, I considered doing a video blog. Sometimes I feel like it is better to convey emotion that way. Maybe I will do one later this week when I feel more inspired. 

This week, I'm going to work two jobs, part time for both. The job I've had for the past two months, I'll be working 4 hours in the morning and then doing another 4 hours in training for the new job I start. I'm glad that I will be starting a new job, and also glad I'm only working a few hours for the job I already have. There's a good chance that this week will probably be hectic and stressful. 

When I was at work yesterday (saturday), there was a point halfway through my shift where I was getting so frustrated with being there, that I had a feeling come over me. A feeling of defeat. A feeling that I was over the job and didn't have the will power to do it anymore. After all, it's a tough job where I move around a lot. I don't know how much longer I can do this job. The reason I haven't just up and quit yet is because we need the money and my wife keeps convincing me to not quit yet. Even though I already have another job. 

That's what makes me unhappy right now, is the fact that I have another job lined up and I still can't just quit the first job all because the training is only 4 hours. 

I just wish that I could get a Web Developer job. It really shouldn't be that hard. Is the pandemic to blame? Is it my skills or experience? I understand that there are other people looking for a Web job as well. It's just that I've been going through a rough time since I graduated. 

<h4>The Good News</h4>

One of the employers that I talked to a few weeks ago updated me last week. She let me know that I might get an interview this week if everything goes well and I am a chosen candidate for the web position. If its not obvious, I may have to find some open time to do the interview if I get the call. I'll have to make a decision if that happens. I may have to call in sick to one of these jobs in order to do the interview for the job I want. 

If I get that interview, it will be a game changer. Ever since the first call, my hopes have been high. I keep thinking about the job. I think it will be at that point if I get the job, life will be better, and I won't be so unhappy about life. There are a few other potential employers that I am waiting for on interviews, but have not received anything in the last few weeks. 


Let's hope that this week turns out better than I anticipate.
