During the past few weeks, it has been a little rough. There was a saturday where my family went and ran errands, and while that was going on, I ran into an ex. It was a surprise. I didn't say anything to her, but I saw her for a second. Just seeing her put me in a mood for almost the next week. I'm over it now, but something inside me happened that affected me. 
 <br><br>
 I thought about my life and where I was going with it. I graduated from college and finally got my degree. School is done. After spending almost the entire summer, I was able to get an actual job in the web field. Now that everything is in place, I have been asking myself, now what? Do I just work every day for the rest of my life? It kind of made me depressed....
 I had to think about what I wanted or even what I wanted to do with my life to try and get out of this funk. 
 <br><br>
 That's when I made a decision.
 I figured I should try to work on one of my hobbies again. It's not really web related. I do it because it is fun and I enjoy doing it.
 <h3>I am going to get back into game streaming</h3>
 Usually when I have been gaming, I just get on and play. But being a streamer has always fascinated me. I haven't really had much success with it, but it is very appealing to me. My plan is to stream in the evening on certain days, and edit videos to put onto youtube. Later on, I will save money to get a better computer to stream with for better quality, with a HD webcam.
 <br><br>
 I know this is a little unorthodox since it isn't all web development related, but its basically about my life and how I am getting through it. Being a Web Developer at this point of my life is just right. You know what I mean? I kind of can't complain about it. My job is nice. It doesn't require me to work hard or long hours. It's not stressful and no one gives me any problems about tasks I work on. Maybe down the road, I will move up and have more work to do daily, but right now, I'm used to the work I do on a day to day basis. I used to feel as though I needed to have as much web knowledge and experience as my colleagues. I doubt I will reach that point anytime soon. Some things I don't understand right away.
 <br>
  Web Development can't be the only thing in my life. I can't just code all day. My brain can't do code all day everyday. I will say this though, I need to continue learning code. I need to continue improving my skills. Maybe after taking a long enough break, I'll get hungry enough to want to learn something? Maybe, we shall see.
