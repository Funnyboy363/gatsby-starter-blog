It's been a good while since I've blogged. Quite a bit has happened in the last few weeks. 
<br>
After doing a ton of paperwork and having to go back and redo some online applications to make sure they are accurate, I finally started my new job. Well. Sort of. 
During this first week, I went through some training and learning to understand my job a little more. I couldn't do any REAL work until I got the work laptop. I finally got that today (friday.)
<br><br>

Here's the interesting thing. 
You would think that I would be happy and content right now since I have this job. Well, I don't know if its because I haven't actually started doing work or what, but lately, I've been going through some emotions. It kind of feels like an existential crisis. I mean, I graduated and got my degree, and now I have a Web Developer job that pays well. It's all come together. I have accomplished what I worked hard for. Now that I am in the moment of, more or less, living the dream, what's next? What do I do now? Just work everyday and make money to pay bills? Live life as it is? Ugh!
<br>
I'll say this. I'm glad to have this job. I'm grateful. If I can, I am going to try and keep it for as long as possible. The first reason is because I am not a fan of finding a job, or doing interviews. It's just not pleasant. The second reason is because this job so far seems to be pretty nice. The work doesn't seem to be to complicated or hard to do. The team lead has been teaching me and I have not been thrown into the fire. I am being eased into the job so that I can understand it all. Not only that, but the pay is good. Like REALLY good. So much better than any of the other Web Development jobs before this. I shouldn't complain. Maybe I just need to find a new goal to work on and look forward to. For this job, a goal I already have in mind is to move up to Senior Developer when possible. I'm sure that pays more than the position I have now.

It's wierd. This week, my interest in video games have dropped a little bit, and I'm kind of okay with that. For example, I am playing Modern Warfare a lot less because I'm starting to get sick of constantly dying and failing. It's just not as fun as it used to be. I don't want to constantly rage. That's why I have been playing minecraft more and playing some fall guys. 
<br><br>
Maybe i just need to find a purpose like I had before. I graduated. I got the job now. It should all be good. I hope after giving it some time and getting into the full work of my new job, I will get out of this funk. My mind still has anxiety sometimes for some reason. That shouldn't be happening. I should just be "In the Moment". You know what, I'm gonna work on this. I should be happy and content. I'm a web developer and I have an awesome job!
