description: "Is this what Web Development is?"
---

Ever get hired for a job, and when you start working, you go in with somewhat of an idea or expectation of how it will be? Then after a few days to a week of working, you get the hang of things and understand what the job consists of? That's basically where I'm at right now. I'm not complaining. I'm just saying that I know what I'm doing now with this career and my day to day work. 
Today, I just got paid from my job. It is awesome! It almost paid rent in full. I can't wait to continue working. 
<br></br>
So its been about three weeks now and I am more into the work. Everyday, there is work to do. Does it keep me busy? Not all day, but I don't find that a problem. As a matter of fact, this job isn't too bad at all. The day to day work consists of working on tickets that are given. At this point, I have the process down of updating the ticket while I do the work. 
<br></br>
It's come to the point where a question has come to mind. "Does this job define web development?" Well its a good question. My idea of doing Web Development work is to get on an Editor and code out something all day while listening to LOFI HIP HOP BEATS TO LISTEN TO WHILE CODING or something like that! In my previous job while working at the college I was going to, I was doing code more than 80% of the time that I worked. With the current job I have now, some of the work I've done hasn't entirely been coding. Some of the work has been working on PDF files and pushing them to the site. 
<br></br>
Tonight as I was winding down for the day, I thought aobut it and realized something interesting. Maybe even a few things. The first thing is that the definition of the idea or term of "Web Development" could mean something different for many companies. For some, it means to code out an app or website from scratch. For another company, it could mean to push content to the public site or edit small parts of code. 
The second thing is that my idea of "Web Development" is usually set in the way of "Coding out a page or site. Editing or updating the content". 
<br></br>
When I was doing work this week, I thought to myself, "I don't know if this is considered web development. This feels more like busy work than the ideal web development I was hoping for." But now, I think that web development could also have the definition of not just coding, but doing work that is in relation to the web. It can be editing a page with text, images or code, or even pushing PDF's to the site. For me, it has come to the point where, if I am busy doing web work for most of the day, it has been a productive and fufilling day to me. 
<br></br>
I would say that right now, things are going well. I have an AMAZING web development job working full time. It is remote, for now, and I can set my hours. I worked for four years to get my degree and graduate. It may have taken almost the entire summer to get this job, but I feel so blessed to have it!
