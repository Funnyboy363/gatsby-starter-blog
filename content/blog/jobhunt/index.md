They say that hunting for a job is essentially a full time job itself. When I started looking for a job back in (technically) May, I wasn't looking as hard as I am now. For some reason, I assumed that it was going to be easy to find a career in web development as soon as I graduated. As time went by, I realized that it was going to be a hard road and a challenge. 

As of today, I have applied at close to 34 open positions on both Indeed, LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter. Only a few have sent me rejection emails. A believe there's a good handful that just haven't responded. I am pretty sure there are more that I have applied at, but I haven't kept track on my google spreadsheet. 

<strong>Today was my day off for the week.</strong> 

Weird right? I guess I can't complain. It has been a nice three day weekend. Throughout today, I spent some of it looking for a job. I went back and forth on the usual job posting sites and applied at where I felt I was qualified for. I also took some initiative and googled some web development companies in Utah. There were a few that I found and applied to or sent my resume out. I also went to LinkedIn and tried to network a little bit. At least one of the companies sent me an email to do a follow up application, so that's progress. 

At first, I thought that I had wasted my whole day, but then I looked back and thought about all that I did. I worked on looking for a job. Which is so much better than sitting on the couch watching tv all day and hoping something happens on its own. 

Today, I made progress and pushed to find my next web development career. As a matter of fact, every time that I apply for a position online (or network) it is progress. It should always be considered progress. 

I think I'll end the blog with that last thought. I felt super productive today. I'm sure the next day I go on the job hunt, I'll push myself to go harder!

(sidenote)
I considered doing a video blog today, but It didn't feel right. There's a good chance I'll do one another day when I feel ready to talk in front of the camera.
