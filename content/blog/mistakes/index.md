Picture this. 

I get home from a long hard day of work. I slump down on the computer to apply for Web Developer jobs (like I've been doing). I sent my application in for a job I thought I was qualified for on Indeed. As I click send, I notice that the link to my portfolio that Indeed saved is...well...WAY incorrect. So I check the account on indeed and, sure enough, the information is wrong. Not just the link to my portfolio, but I'm pretty sure a lot of other information. 

I had different feelings. The first, was shock. How could I not check my resume information on indeed? Why did I assume it had the correct information? Maybe I just thought it would take the info from my resume I uploaded? Who knows.
The second feeling was annoyance. I was not amused that I was accidentally sending out information that wasn't accurate and most likely from a long time ago...or however long. 
The third feeling was dissapointment. I was so dissapointed in myself for not seeing this problem before. Mistakes like this make me hate myself. 

So I went ahead and fixed the issue. Now that I have updated everything that I could on Indeed, I think I'm going to go back to previous applications and try to resend them with the new AND better information. 

I certainly hope this isn't the reason why I haven't recieved any calls from any employers. Jeez!
