I suppose I could just leave you with the description of this blog and call it good, but I kind of want to talk about what has been going on this week. 

This week, I started my new job, which is not Web related. The training is only a few hours, so I still have to work at the other job for a few hours as well. I'm not happy about it. The training for the second job goes for the next two weeks, which means I HAVE to work other first job for the next two weeks as well. 
It's a change of pace that isn't that bad because I work my first job for four hours, go home to shower, and then go to the second job, which is another four hours. Now that I know the routine, it's making life a little better. 

I'm not giving up on trying though. 

I'm still applying for Web Development jobs out there and trying my hardest to get through it. I'm trying to improve my skills anyway that I can, but I feel like I could be doing more. 

I still haven't heard from one of the employers I was hoping to get an interview with. At this point, I don't think I'll get the job since it's almost August. I was expecting something this last week. 
It's come to the point where I have to try not to get my hopes up. I won't give up on trying, but I'm not going to keep looking at my phone expecting an employer to call me saying that they are interested and want to give me a job offer. 

I've been trying my hardest to land a web development job since june....and nothing.
I don't know when I will be given the chance, nay, the opportunity to work in the web field. I don't know if will happen soon or if it will take a few more months. I just hope that I get lucky soon. 

<h4>Unexpected job posting</h4>

Another thing I want to talk about real quick. While I was on break at my second job this week, I was looking at job postings. I noticed that there was an open position at the job I was working that was web related earlier this year. I was surprised. I was curious if there was something going on because I was under the impression that they were doing a hiring freeze until further notice because of the pandemic. 

Well, I applied to see if I could get the chance for an interview and come back. I'm not going to get my hopes up though. I was never promoted more than a student position when working there. There were some reasons that I was given as to why I didn't get an actual staff position, which I don't agree with. 

I suppose if they don't call me for an interview, I'll know that nothing changed. I'll know that those previous reasons of not getting promoted are still the reasons of why I can't come back. At that point, I won't look back and just move on from them.

<h4>Ending thoughts</h4>
It's been rough. Things are slightly getting better. 
Yes, this blog post is on the negative side. I am/have been working on being more positive.
I will try to think positive and not be so down on myself.
My wife keeps telling me to stop being negative and think better of myself. 
I guess that means I should work on my self esteem....
I'm actually a pretty good web developer. I shouldn't let the fact I haven't found a Web job bring me down.

Thanks for reading :)
