There have been times before this when I have been on the job hunt where I have gone through the same feeling as I am right now. It sucks. It's hard to deal with. 

As of lately, I have been on the job hunt trying to get a web development job. I either don't get an email at all, or I get a rejection email from the company I applied at. I have also been learning some code and working on some projects when I get the time. 

Because I haven't had much luck with getting a job or getting interviews, it's been putting me in a mindset that I have a hard time escaping. Imposter Syndrome.
It's getting to the point where I am starting to feel like I'm not good enough. Like, no matter how many times I apply and send in my resume to web companies, I'm just not being given the chance to prove myself. 

A thought has also come across my mind that really brings me down. Since I haven't found a job in the last 2-3 months, it's kind of making me feel like I went to school and got my degree for nothing. I was planning on doing full time web development right after graduating. I didn't think it would be that hard. Well, i'm pretty sure because of the pandemic, it is pretty hard. There's probably a lot of other web developers out there applying for the same jobs as I am. 

Part of me also feels like I need to study, learn, and practice code more in order to land a job. I've been trying to learn more any way possible. Whether it be documentation, examples, or a lot of youtube videos, I've been working on improving my skills. Two points of concern for learning code are:
1) There's no way to know for sure when it is enough to learn and master any programming skill.
2) There's so many programming skills to learn, I don't know where to start or which ones I should really learn. 

AAAHHH!!! I hate this. This is what i've been dealing with lately. The good ol' imposter syndrome. 
I will keep at it and try my best to get a job. 

Another thing that happened recently that brought me down: I saw a post on LinkedIn that a fellow classmate got hired for one of the places I applied at. Don't get me wrong, it's good that this person got the job, but it pains me since I wasn't even given an interview. I'm not saying that this individual doesn't deserve the job, I don't hate the person. It just sucks I wasn't given the chance. 

I think it's accurate to say that this week wasn't a very good one. I have some interviews this coming week. Hopefully they will go well and I will get at least one job offer. 

Thank you for reading. Any moral support is greatly appreciated.
