I feel like this should be a video blog because of how happy I am, but for now, I will just write out what has happened.

So just a few days ago, on Wednesday, I had the day off. When I woke up that morning, I had no idea what was going to happen. If I did know, I probably would have gone through the day slighly different. But I am glad that it happened on my day off. I had an interview set up for a tech company. What's funny is that it turned into about three interviews from different companies that day, which was a surprise. 

I was sitting at my desk watching youtube and I got a call. It was from an individual that I talked to last month about a position that I was SUPER excited for. I figured at this point that they already chose a candidate since it was taking so long for a response. As it turns out, the contract for the position was finally "Won" and they were able to move forward for the hiring of the job. I was in shock. I was amazed. There was still hope for me yet! We ended up setting up an interview that day since I wasn't working. 

I went through the first two, and they were pretty good. Then the last call was for the manager of the department that I was going to work in. I think we talked for about 45 minutes about myself and the job and if I would be a good fit. I had no idea what was about to happen because nothing was set in stone. Sure enough, towards the end of the call, she said that she was going to contact the HR Manager (which I was talking to before) to start getting the paper work started. I questioned if that meant that I got the job. She didn't really come out and say it. The interesting this is, there wasn't any sort of code test or assessment that was planned for me to do. I assume that my portfolio was good enough. I won't complain about it though.
About half an hour later, I got a call from the HR individual about the paper work and she confirmed it. "It looks like you got the job, Grant. Congratulations!", she said. It was then and there that everything started to change. I cried a little from happiness at that point. It meant that I could get back into the swing of things. Get back into the field of web development. 

I spent the rest of the day doing paperwork. Actually, it took the next two days to get it done, but that wasn't a problem. I still have some other things that need to happen first. I need to wait on the background check. I also will need to do a drugscreening. And I will need to do online orientation before I start.

At this point, I feel like everything will be fine. I also feel like I can move on from my frustrations with my previous job. I wasn't happy about how they treated me during the last few months of working there. I wasn't getting an opportunity to move up from the position I was in. I can also move on from the fact that they posted a job opening for the position that I wanted for a while. Because I have this awesome new opportunity in my life, the previous one doesn't matter anymore. That job was a stepping stone in my career in Web Development. 

I gotta say, I am so happy that this happened! The past three months have been harsh. I haven't been myself. I have been hating life. My mindset was tilted because I was wanting to find a Web Development job so badly. I was applying for as many jobs as I could that I felt I was qualified for. I think things will get better at this point once I start working. I am also going to try to keep this job as long as possible. I am not a fan of looking for another job, or even going through interviews. 

When I get the chance, I will attempt to do a video blog, but I want it to be epic. I may just wait until I get a nice video camera to do it. 
Thanks for reading! Cheers!
