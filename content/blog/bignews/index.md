Alright, well. Where to start?

First off, I want to put it out there, that I have reflected on myself lately. My mindset has not been a good one because it has been rough with being able to land a web related job. My dad talked to me today and he said that he was concerned for me because he knew that I was going through a rough time. I decided that I need to try and be more positive and not focus on the negative so much. 

With that being said, here's what went down lately that has made me kind of happy. On friday, I got a message from a hiring manager for a business that I applied to. 

<h4>When I read the message, I instantly felt like things were going to start getting better!</h4>

She asked me to call her to talk more about the position, so I called almost immediately. She told me it was for a Web Developer position that was full time. There was other information that got me real excited! She made me feel like all the hard work paid off in going to UVU to get my degree. We talked about the job as well as my resume and work history. I was informed that if I added projects and freelance to the resume, it would increase my chances of getting the job. Towards the end of the call, she said that she will send the updated resume to the person in charge of the team and see if I can get an interview. 

As soon as I got home that night, I updated my resume. My wife helped me with some adjustments to make it look nice, since she works as an HR Manager. Once it was good to go, I sent it to the recruiter in order to be productive.

Now at this point, I hope that I will get the interview and land the job within the coming weeks.

Oh man! I have been thinking about this all day! I'm so excited but also anxious. I do know that right now, nothing is set in stone. There's still things that need to be done. Even thought that is the case, it's like I can see the "light at the end of the tunnel". I can't help it. 
I hope I get this job! It will make my life better and it will help my family too! Stay tuned! I will update this blog as I go!
