I remember back in 2017 when I first started my journey doing web development. I was new to EVERYTHING. I was learning code, I was learning design, I was learning so many different things when it all started. Almost every day when I was going to class, I was getting excited about what I was learning. 
<br><br>
Here's the point of my blog. There were days back in 2017 to 2019 when I was either driving around in the car or going on walks with my wife. While we were on these adventures, I would always talk about how excited I am to graduate from college with my Web Development degree. My words would usually be, <em>"I can't wait for the day when I graduate and get a career in Web Development. Things will be so much better for us!".</em> 
<br><br>
Now that I have done all that, I don't say that anymore. Isn't that weird? Like, I'm actually living in the moment of what I was waiting to do. If you're wondering what I say now, it's completely different things. Because I have a job in Web Development, I'm not saying anything about finding a job. I say things like, <em>"Time to save for a house", "Time to start paying off debt", "I can start saving money to buy all these things I want!".</em>
<br><br>
<strong>Side Note:</strong><br>
Yes, the journey of going through all the hard work matters too! I could write a book about what I experienced going to college. There was something different that I went through almost every day. Every semester. There were different web related things I learned, people I met and made friends with, there were also adventures I went on with friends as part of the classes that I took. Heck, I remember my work had a BBQ at a park during the summer as part of a meeting. It was awesome! We hung out and talked and ate such good food! 
<br><br>
It's facinating how the things I looked forward to in the future change once I accomplished certain goals. Earlier today, I was running some errands real quick and once I got home, a thought had crossed my mind that made today perfect. I just went through FOUR years of college. I experienced going to school all year to get my degree. I even did summer classes to get it finished as soon as I could. Before this summer, all that I knew was going to school and having a part time job, and now, without noticing very much, my routine, my life, my experience is all completely different. I work doing Web Development all day. It's awesome!
