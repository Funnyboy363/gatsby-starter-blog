While I was going through my day, working and doing web development work for my job, I had an interesting thought. Which led to some more thoughts that had me thinking about my past. 
<br><br>
At my last job that I worked, I was doing web work at the college I was attending. I was thinking about how when I started, I really liked the job! I enjoyed going into work everyday! I got to work with really great people too. I even blogged about how great of a feeling it was having the job because I was getting paid to code and do web development. I was practically living the dream!! 
<br><br>
There were some setbacks that made it feel like an introductory job. It was part time. It was a student position. Because of the fact that I could set my own schedule for those hours, it made it work for taking classes. That's probably the best part about it.
<br><br>
Then some interesting things happened that took a turn and changed my perspective. I don't want to get too much into it, but certain things happened during the fall of 2019 that changed it all. It began with an interview that apparently didn't go right. I was informed later on from the manager that I wasn't being proactive enough and that was one of the reasons I didn't get the promotion. I later found out there were other reasons, but it was all rediculous anyway. 
<br><br>
Not getting the promotion that I applied for hurt. It made me feel like I wasn't a potential web developer. It made me feel like I was suddenly not going to get anywhere in life because I couldn't move up. Looking back it made me grateful that I found this job I have now and be able to move on from that hurtful past. 
<br><br>
Thinking about all this made me hope that I don't go through any of those things with this new job. If I do anything to screw it up, I will end up right back where I was at the beginning of the summer, desperately looking for a company that will hire me for web work. So I decided there were some things I need to work on to be the best I can at my job:
<ul>
<li>PROACTIVE: I need to be as proactive as possible</li>
<li>GRATEFUL: I need to always be grateful for the job I have</li>
<li>POSITIVE: I need to not speak negatively to anyone about anything, whether it be a coworker or team lead</li>
<li>HUMBLE: I need to be willing to learn and take critism.</li>
</ul>

Some of these things were factors of why I didn't move up and why I ended up not liking my job, MORE so not liking certain individuals in the end. I can't let these problems happen with this job. I don't want to end up being miserable in this job like the last one, so I will do what I can to be the best employee.
