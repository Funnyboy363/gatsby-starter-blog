This may not be a huge deal, but even the smallest things matter. A few days ago, I was at the job I currently work. I was talking to a fellow co-worker about how the day was going for us. I mentioned to him that I was looking for another job on the side. He was curious about it so I told him that I just graduated UVU in Web Development so I really want to get a career doing that. To my surprise, he told me that he had a friend that worked at Adobe. 

Come today, he got my info and portfolio to send to the friend. I thought, "Awesome! We shall see what happens". About an hour goes by, and he shows me a text from the friend where she seemed interested in my work. She also liked that I was a full stack developer. 

That was it for the situation, but here's what I have thought about since that all happened.

Networking can be useful. Apparently, it can also be accidental. I had no intention of this co-worker helping me out in any way when I was talking to him. I was only talking to him about my plans and where I wanted to go in life. I wasn't seeking any benefit of any sort when in conversation. 

Isn't that beautiful? 

This kind of makes me want to do some more networking and see if that helps in any way to land a job. I'm seeing people on LinkedIn getting jobs from networking, which is quite the inspiration. It pays to have friends on the inside and connections. I suppose I should work on that a whole lot more!

It feels like, everyday, I get closer to landing a sweet web development career because of the different things I've been doing to get a job. Everything from applying on the usual job posting sites to straight up talking to people to try and get my foot in the door. It's crazy because I feel like I can almost see the light sometimes and get a job, but when in reality, I'm not there yet. The success won't be there until I get the job offer.
