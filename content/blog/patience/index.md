description: "You want it now, but in reality, you gotta wait"

This morning, as I was getting up, I was in a big mood. I wasn't happy, I was stressed, I hated almost everything going on in my mind. 

I was attempting to see if I could work for grub hub to deliver food. The problem I was facing was finding the registration for the car I was going to use, but we couldn't find it. This meant that I either wasn't going to work for grub hub or it was going to be delayed. I ended up going to work and biting the bullet. Today was going to be long and rough.

As time went on later in the day, I worked, got through it and finished the day off. As I was getting food, <strong>I got an email from a company I applied at to do an interview!</strong> I was so excited! It made me so happy! They were quick to respond because I applied at least two days ago. I felt a big weight lifted! I was finally given a chance to prove myself and get a web related job!

But then there was a catch......

When I got home, I looked and got one set up for about two weeks from now. Kind of a long wait. I wish I could do the interview sooner, but there wasn't anything available sooner than what I scheduled. 

What's interesting to think about on this day are some things I want to cover. 

<strong>The stress of looking for a web related job: </strong>
An issue going on right now is the pandemic. If that wasn't going on right now, it might just be easier to get a web developer job than what i'm dealing with right now. There's a big list of them on the job posting sites I go to. Some of them I feel i'm qualified for and some I think I would be a great fit. 

<strong>The mindset of "I want a web job and I want it now!":</strong>
I've gone through this before. I apply at web development companies and assume that the process will be easy and/or quick. As the days go by, I keep looking at my phone or hoping that I'll get a call within a few days. What's unfortunate is that, with this pandemic, It's not going to happen right away. It takes time. The process of finding a web development job isn't sudden because not only are web companies looking for the right fit, but you are looking for the right fit for yourself as well. 

<strong>The mindset of "Do the companies not like my resume? Do I not qualify?":</strong>
I always try to understand that its not personal. I also wonder what companies I applied at looked at my resume. I've heard of ATS. I'm sure that web companies get a lot of candidates. If a company does send me a rejection email, they don't EVER provide a reason why I wasn't chosen. If they did, and they gave me specific information, I would know what I needed to improve on. 

Wrapping up these thoughts, I am going to try not to stress out too much about finding a web development job. I want to get that job, but it's not going to happen instantly. I have to wait, I have to have the patience, and hope that a company comes along to give me a chance. Maybe it's this one? Who knows. At least while I wait, I can code and improve my skills.

<strong>(Post thoughts)</strong>
After I scheduled the interview, I looked back on the last month or two and thought about how many jobs I've applied at to get this interview. I tell ya. It was a lot. 

But you know what the best feeling is? It's when you get a call or an email for an interview after a rough time of not getting anything. It changed my mood so much! I just hope that this company offers me a job. We shall see!
