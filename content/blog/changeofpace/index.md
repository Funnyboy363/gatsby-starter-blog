Today, I had an interview for a job. It wasn't web related, but that's not an issue. I went to the interview for this job for a few reasons. I'm not going to say who it is because that's not the point of this blog. I'm going to talk about the emotions and a little about what I went through. 

First, I am still having trouble with landing a web related job. I'm pretty confident it might be because of two reasons. 1) The companies are being careful and not hiring just anyone since the pandemic started. 2) My resume/portfolio doesn't match what they need. I am sure I'll find a job that needs me and my skills. 
With that being said, I am applying at some jobs that are still tech type but not web related. I widened my radius of the job search. 

Second, the job description gave info that made me feel like I could do the job. It wasn't complicated or really that much of a challenge. It would be in an office and be inside where its nice and air conditioned. 

Third, distance. It is in orem which is a pretty good distance from home. Not a far drive. Usually the distance is a factor when it comes to a job. If a web development company in sandy or murray hired me, I would definetely take it. Just want to notate that. 

I also want to note, that it has been rough in the past few months. With the job I currently have, the conditions are harsh, the work is rough. I'm working in the heat and when I get off work, almost my whole body hurts. I've been trying so hard to stick with the job, but to be honest, its really not the type of job for me. 

<h3>With that being said, let's get to the experience!</h3>

So I went to the interview today and went through the motions of the hiring process. I did well for myself even though I was nervous. I had no idea if I was going to get the job or not so I tried my hardest to do things right and not say anything stupid. I went through their testing to show I could do the job. Doing this gave me an idea of what I would be doing if I got hired there. 

Afterwards, I then needed to meet with their hiring manager to talk as part of the process. Because of the pandemic, it was through chat on the computer. He noticed that my resume showed that my previous jobs were web development and he asked me about it. I responded and told him that its been rough getting a web related job because of the pandemic and he immediately understood. That made me happy. 
After talking about the job and answering and asking questions, the interview ended and I went home. 
I left with my head held high and felt accomplished. I had no idea if I was going to get the job, but I was super hopeful. 

<h3>And then my day got better.</h3>

I was home for about ten minutes. I got an email from the company with a job offer. I WAS SO HAPPY! I literally cried. It was at that moment that a whole lot of stress and anxiety left me. My day to day routine was going to change. I accepted the offer, filled out some online forms and sent it. I also did a drug screening later on. Now at this point, I just need to wait for a follow up email to know when I can start doing training. 

Like I said, It isn't a web related job, but that's completely okay right now. I think with this job, I can take some time to learn more code, practice, and improve my skills as a Web Developer when I am not working. I don't know how long I will work at this job, but It would be fine if it's any where between a few months to a year. I feel so much better at this point! I feel happy and I will be so much more happier once I start this job! 

As of right now, I can't quite quit the job I am currently doing yet because I have no idea when the training for this one starts. That part does suck, but I still need to work to get a paycheck. I'm hoping that training starts soon. 

<h5>Side Note</h4>
I am currently planning and working on a personal project I have an idea for. It may take some time because I'm going to make it from scratch. I hope it works! Stay tuned!
