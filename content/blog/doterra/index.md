It has been a VERY interesting year in Web Development for me. Like Wow! And things are going to change now. <br>
The job that I was lucky to get last year came to an end. Got a call on a Monday morning. Was told that my contract was coming to an end and they could not continue my employment. They said that they would be giving me two weeks. <br>
The first few days of knowing this gave me anxiety and made me bummed because I really liked the job, for one, and for two, I am not a fan of getting another job. 
<br>
Almost immediately after getting the news, i started looking for a job. My wife helped me with adjusting and updating my resume so that it would look good. I applied at a good handful of places and was kind of skeptical that I wouldn't get that many responses because of how bad I had it last year. <br>
Well to my amazement, there were a few employers that responded to me for interviews. I had to try not to get too excited because, you never know.<br>
So, I did the interviews, also finished out my two weeks with the job and hoped for the best. <br>
Yesterday, I had an interview for a job, which was a web development related job. The individual that I interviewed with was awesome! He was friendly and talkative. He talked to me about the company, the work, and we also talked about my work experience. It was wonderful! Towards the end of the interview, he said that if they decide to hire me, that I should expect an offer letter through email later on. <br>
Well, guess what! Flash forward to a few hours later, the person I interviewed with texted me to let me know that he talked to HR about me and that I should expect the offer letter soon! I was so happy and excited! This meant that I didn't have to worry about looking for a job anymore! I had a new one! I was thrilled!<br><br>
So if you're wondering here's why I'm even bloggin after all this time. <br />
This last year working the previous job, I worked from home. You may think it's the best thing ever, but it eventually gets to be vanilla and bland. I didn't have much social interaction with people and I was in the office room which is where my personal computer and gaming computer are also sitting. So there's plenty of distraction and temptation to play video games and goof off. NOT A GOOD THING. And that's why I'm looking foward to this new job! I will be able to get out of the house. I will be able to socialize with people. It will at least be a nice new setting because I'll be working in an office! I don't know all the details, hopefully I can listen to music or watch streams while I work. We shall see. It should be a great opportunity.
